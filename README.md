# Telemedic
An implementation of an online telemedicine service

The purpose of building this app was to test my ability in managing a complex project. I am not exceptionally proud of myself because there are some kinks here and there, but the app works at the very least.

I was able to achieve a lot, taking inspirations from messaging services I use, and others.

## Implementation

1. I implemented a chat system where Doctors can chat with Patients. It was built using [Socket.IO]([https://socket.io).

2. I also implemented a video chat system. Doctors and Patients can have video calls, powered by WebRTC. Simple-peer was used to achieve this. I had to fix a lot of lag issues. I was able to fix a few.

3. The design chosen for the chat interface was inspired by Microsoft Outlook.

4. The frontend was built with Bootstrap 3 and jQuery. The backend was built with NodeJS, using the express framework, as well as other packages.

## Conclusion

A few days after its completion, I figured out solutions to the bugs which still exist in the app. I have also figured out new and exciting ways to properly develop large-scale apps like this efficiently, which I will use for further projects.
I won't edit the source code again.
